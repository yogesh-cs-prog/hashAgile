Warning: Async search does not support scroll nor search requests that only include the suggest section. By default, Elasticsearch doesnâ€™t allow you to store an async search response larger than 10Mb and an attempt to do this results in an error. The maximum allowed size for a stored async search response can be set by changing the `search.max_async_search_response_size` cluster level setting.
